**AgriChain – Blockchain-Based Agricultural Supply Chain**

AgriChain is a blockchain-powered solution designed to bring transparency, trust, and fairness to the agricultural supply chain. The platform enables end-to-end tracking of agricultural produce from farmers to consumers while ensuring fair pricing, secure transactions, and verified product quality.

**About the Project**

The agricultural supply chain often lacks transparency, leading to unfair pricing for farmers, delayed payments, and uncertainty for consumers regarding product quality and origin. AgriChain addresses these challenges by leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts to create a tamper-proof and trustworthy supply chain ecosystem.

By recording every stage of the produce lifecycle on the blockchain, AgriChain ensures accountability, reduces fraud, and builds confidence among farmers, distributors, retailers, and consumers.
