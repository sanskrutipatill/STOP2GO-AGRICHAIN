**AgriChain – Blockchain-Based Agricultural Supply Chain**

AgriChain is a blockchain-powered solution designed to bring transparency, trust, and fairness to the agricultural supply chain. The platform enables end-to-end tracking of agricultural produce from farmers to consumers while ensuring fair pricing, secure transactions, and verified product quality.
